# Omnifood Company Project

## Introduction:

The Omnifood Project is a project that I've created and implemented during the course "Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS". <br/>
This project aimed to learn about Real-World Web Design techniques, the power of CSS, and apply the knowledge that I got from the course into a Real Web Application. <br />
In this project I could go through all the 7 steps to a great website, and apply fundamental steps like test and optmize, to assure that this application will work properly to all kind of browsers users.
